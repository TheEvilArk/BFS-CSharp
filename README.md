# BFS-CSharp
Search by levels of sequential viewing of individual graph levels.  Consider all the edges (u, v) (u, v) emerging from the node u. If the next node is the target node, then the search ends; in case node v is added to the queue. After all nodes exiting the node are checked, the next node is retrieved from the queue, and the process repeats.
